# Housing Alerts

Housing Alerts is a simple advocacy tool to help housing organizations notify supporters about upcoming **public hearings**.  
Supporters can sign up for updates in specific **regions**, and administrators can publish hearings that automatically trigger email notifications.  

The goal is to make this tool easy to deploy for any housing advocacy group with **minimal cost and setup**.

## üöÄ Purpose

- Allow community members to **subscribe** to updates for their region.  
- Allow administrators to **publish hearings** (title, description, optional image).  
- Automatically **notify subscribers via email** (powered by SendGrid SMTP).  
- Support **multiple organizations**, so the tool can be reused by groups in different cities.  
- Provide **unsubscribe** functionality to respect user choice and email regulations.

### Database Schema

- `slug` (unique identifier for URLs)  
- `contact_email`  

**Users**  
- `id`  
- `name`  
- `email`  
- `password` (hashed, for admin users)  
- `organization_id` (FK ‚Üí organizations)  
- `unsubscribed_at` (timestamp, null if active)  

**Regions**  
- `id`  
- `organization_id` (FK ‚Üí organizations)  
- `name`  

**Hearings**  
- `id`  
- `organization_id` (FK ‚Üí organizations)  
- `region_id` (FK ‚Üí regions)  
- `title`  
- `body` (hearing details)  
- `image_url` (optional)  

**User_Region (pivot table)**  
- `id`  
- `user_id` (FK ‚Üí users)  
- `region_id` (FK ‚Üí regions)

## üîë Relationships

- **Organization** has many **Users**, **Regions**, and **Hearings**.  
- **User** belongs to one **Organization** and may subscribe to many **Regions**.  
- **Region** belongs to one **Organization**, has many **Hearings**, and has many **Users** (via `user_region`).  
- **Hearing** belongs to one **Organization** and one **Region**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Major Components

### 1. **Authentication**
- Laravel‚Äôs built-in authentication system (`User` model).  
- Admin users can log in to manage hearings.  

### 2. **Public Signup**
- Supporters provide **email** and select **regions**.  
- Stored in the `users` table with region subscriptions in `user_region`.  

### 3. **Admin Dashboard**
- CRUD for **hearings**.  
- When a hearing is created, all users subscribed to the matching region are emailed.  

### 4. **Email Notifications**
- Emails sent through **SendGrid SMTP**.  
- Each email includes an **unsubscribe link**.  
- Templates handled with Laravel **Mailable classes** and Blade views.  

### 5. **Unsubscribe Flow**
- Clicking unsubscribe marks `unsubscribed_at` on the `users` table.  
- User will no longer receive notifications.
